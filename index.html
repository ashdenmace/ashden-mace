            <p>I am currently located in Portland Oregon, and have some experience in javascript, html, css and a little python. Growing up gaming on computers is probably what sparked my interest in them. In recent years, I've learned more about whats going on in the background which made me realize my interest in programming.</p>    
            <p>I graduated with a degree in Business Information Systems, and in college the majority of my time was spent working with others on projects. I’ve found that I’ve always been able to work with others easily and efficiently and am always eager to learn from my peers.</p>
